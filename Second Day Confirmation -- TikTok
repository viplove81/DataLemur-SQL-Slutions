Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. 
New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.
Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.
Definition:
action_date refers to the date when users activated their accounts and confirmed their sign-up through text messages.
