Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. 
Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.
Definition and note:
Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.
